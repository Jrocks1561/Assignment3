Queue_stuffs
This code is much simpler than my last code.  This code it much easier as i preloaded the queue with values 1 - 10 and then afeter loosing a vue to the pop function i pushed on 11. The code tells you what its doing with every print statement and you can see that I checked the the queue looks good.
